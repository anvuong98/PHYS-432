Python codes: 
	Assignment4_1: This is a compiler of the Advection Equation. The code generates 2 
			plots comparing the 2 methods: FTCS and Lax-Friedrichs. We can 				clearly see that FTCS diverges really quickly whereas 
			Lax-Friedrichs is very stable


	Assignment4_2: This is a compiler of the Diffusion Advection Equation. The code 			generates 2 plots with different Diffusion coefficients [0.1, 1] 			and we can compare the effect of diffusion in advection
